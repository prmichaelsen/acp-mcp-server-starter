## Local Development Directories

This package includes local-only directories for development workflow:

### Clarifications (`agent/clarifications/`)

Use this directory to document questions and clarifications during development:
- Create clarification documents using the template: `clarification-{N}-{title}.template.md`
- Document requirements gaps, design questions, and implementation decisions
- **Local by default**: Content files are gitignored, only `.gitkeep` is tracked
- **Optional tracking**: Remove patterns from `.gitignore` to track specific clarifications

### Feedback (`agent/feedback/`)

Use this directory to capture feedback during development:
- Document user feedback, bug reports, and feature requests
- Keep notes about what works and what needs improvement
- **Local by default**: Content files are gitignored, only `.gitkeep` is tracked
- **Optional tracking**: Remove patterns from `.gitignore` to track specific feedback

### Reports (`agent/reports/`)

Session reports and development logs:
- Automatically generated by `@acp.report` command
- **Local by default**: Content files are gitignored, only `.gitkeep` is tracked
- **Optional tracking**: Remove patterns from `.gitignore` to track specific reports

**Note**: These directories follow the same pattern - they exist in the repository structure (via `.gitkeep`), but their content is local-only by default. You can choose to track specific files by removing them from `.gitignore`.

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing pattern structure
2. Use entity creation commands (@acp.pattern-create, etc.)
3. Run @acp.package-validate before committing
