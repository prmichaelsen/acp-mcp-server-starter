      - ✅ Analyzed package.json, tsconfig.json, build config
      - ✅ Studied MCP server implementation (server.ts, server-factory.ts)
      - ✅ Examined tool creation patterns (create-memory.ts example)
      - ✅ Reviewed build tooling (esbuild dual build)
      - ✅ Analyzed testing setup (Jest + ts-jest ESM)
      - ✅ Studied configuration management (config.ts, .env.example)
      - ✅ Created comprehensive analysis document (agent/design/remember-mcp-analysis.md)
      - ✅ Identified 9 reusable patterns for extraction
      - ✅ Documented recommendations for 7 patterns, 2 commands, 2 designs
      - ✅ Task 1 completed successfully

      📋 @acp.plan Executed: Complete Project Planning
      Created 3 milestones with 14 tasks for package development.
    items:
      - ✅ Created Milestone 1: Pattern Documentation (7 tasks, 2-3 weeks)
      - ✅ Created Milestone 2: Command & Design Documentation (4 tasks, 1-2 weeks)
      - ✅ Created Milestone 3: Package Validation & Publishing (3 tasks, 1 week)
      - ✅ Created 14 task documents with complete specifications
      - ✅ Organized tasks in milestone-specific directories
      - ✅ Updated progress.yaml with all milestones and tasks
      - ✅ Established clear dependencies and workflow
      - ✅ Estimated 4-6 weeks total development time

next_steps:
  - Start Milestone 1: Create pattern documents (Task 2-8)
  - Use @acp.proceed to begin Task 2 (Bootstrap Pattern)
  - Use @acp.pattern-create for each pattern
  - Update package.yaml as patterns are created
  - Validate patterns with @acp.package-validate

notes:
  - This is an ACP package repository
  - Use entity creation commands to add content
  - Create milestones and tasks as you plan development
  - progress.yaml is for development only (not installed to user projects)
